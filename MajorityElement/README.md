# Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than (n / 2) times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

## Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 5 * 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution

Time Complexity : O(n)

    Time complexity quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Space Complexity: O(1)

    Space complexity is a metric to compare the amount of memory required to run an algorithm in relation to its input size. If the input gets bigger, how much storage the algorithm requires?
